This is my techbag business website. Here, you can support its production by donating. 
This is the first professional and real world website I have built and I hope you like my project. 

Tech Stack:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT

Features: 

1. Navbar 

At the top I have a navbar which is sticky because of the position: fixed CSS property.

Also when we scroll beyond the hero section, the properties of the navbar changes. This was made possible using the intersection observer javascript property. 

Also, the navbar is made responsive for mobile and smaller teblets. 

2. Layout

Being my first website, I poured a lot of love and time inside this website. As you can  probably see.

I have a beautiful gallery in my brief overview section which when hovered zooms in in. This was made possible using the hover pseudo class and the transform: scale property
